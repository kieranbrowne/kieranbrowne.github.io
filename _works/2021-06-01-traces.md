    content: While I was at Google Creative Lab (2021-2022), one of the longest running projects I worked on was a partnership with Australia's leading Indigenous publishing house, Magabala Books. Through the process we got to work with artist/poet Kirli Saunders and artist/illustrator Kamsani Bin Salleh to design and develop a project that applied digital technology in service of storytelling. The outcome of this was *Traces*; a voice-to-art experience, honouring 60,000+ years of Indigenous storytelling.

    content: The wrap-film above gives a strong sense of the meaning and experience of the work in the words of the artists. Traces was primarily shaped by aspects of Kirli and Kam's arts practices. The projections were generated in response to spoken word; both live in the space and from a poem written and recorded by Kirli, and the visual elements were drawn by Kam and recombined programmatically to form new compositions.

    content: We explored several ideas for the colour palette of the work, but what resonated most with Kirli and Kam was drawing on the colours of Country.
