*Complicit Cinema* is an experimental cinema that requires focussed attention from the viewer. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is used to measure the viewer's brain activity and this allows the scene to move forward.
As the scene progresses higher levels of brain activity are required for it to continue. The footage will stop or even reverse if the watcher 
loses concentration.

## Artist statement
Hollywood's growing industry of violent cinema such as the multi-million dollar 
[Saw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saw_(franchise)) franchise has revealed an
 enormous public appetite for graphic violence and gore.
The passivity of film excuses the viewer of their part in the
violence. It disguises the truth that it is the viewer/consumer for whom the
violence is performed and their appetite for suffering that is being satiated.
The feedback loop between viewer/consumer and the creation of violence is too
large to be visible to those it feeds.

This work takes the relationship of viewer/consumer to the creation
of violence and shrinks the feedback loop to make it visible. It establishes
the interest of the viewer as the driving force in the system; the role
otherwise held by the progression of time. Within the installation, the scene 
will not play without an audience, nor will it continue without a focused mind 
to consume it.

## The effects on the viewer
The installation plays the iconic shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film *Psycho*. For the viewer, the experience of this scene is transformed. Audience members invariably find themselves associating most strongly with the killer.
This may be because he is the primary agent in the scene or that his 
face is never shown, allowing viewers to imagine themselves in his place.
Regardless, the viewer's assumption of this role heightens the perverse
enjoyment of the content. The mental energy required to continue the scene 
increases with the scene itself. It can take a viewer some time to progress the 
scene to actual violence. And so, it can feel like an achievement to make the 
killer's knife meet the victim's skin.
