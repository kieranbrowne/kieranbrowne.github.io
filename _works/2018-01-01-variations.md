      content: In 2018 I did a series of daily generative art experiments attempting to recreate with code numerous paintings, drawings and prints of 20th century modern art.

      content: For these studies I would find an artwork on a museum website (usually the Tate) and try to reproduce it as closely as I could in code. After creating a close copy I would play with the resulting code to produce variations of the composition. The resulting images are somewhere between copies and originals, being technically novel, but deeply indebted to the creativity of the original author.
