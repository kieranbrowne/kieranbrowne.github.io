*Artificial Artists* is a series of art machines that contribute to the creation of visual "ideas" as well as the production of images. 
The machines vary in style and each was created to express a unique persona. The aim with the works is to push the limits of non-human artistry.

In judging whether an art object is ‘the real thing’, we tend to care mostly about the means by which it came into existence. Hence, the question of whether machines can take the credit for producing genuine art, is essentially a question about what kind of processes count as artistic and which do not. If a machine cannot simply imitate the production of artworks  but distill images to produce original visual output, it is no longer imitating artistry, it is performing it.
