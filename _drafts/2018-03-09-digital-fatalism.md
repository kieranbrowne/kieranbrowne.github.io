Jaron Lanier’s manifesto cum [red scare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare) paranoia *You Are Not a Gadget* (2010) challenges the structures and politics of “Web 2.0” era digital culture. Not all of the ideas in the book have aged well and some likely never made sense, but his examination of crystallisation of ideas through software representations is still relevant and its lessons are yet to be learned. In this post I want to look at Lanier’s analysis of software representation and challenge his suggestion that these metaphors are “locked in”.

*You Are Not a Gadget* is written at an turning point in the history of the web; after the dot com bust and the emergence of web 2.0 but before Facebook executives had worked out how to monetise the platform. These years saw the waning of the personal home page as a defining unit of authorship on the web and the birth of the media prosumer and the social network. For Lanier, these developments represent a wrong turn in the digital revolution, one which threatens to reshape society and our notion of personhood. Particularly, Lanier takes aim at openness and anonymity on web platforms such as Wikipedia which, he suggests, mark a secession of individual identity to groupthink.

Lanier implicitly draws on entrenched archetypes of Eastern and Western culture in his critique. He blames the state of network culture on “digital Maoists” a group consisting of open source contributors, Creative Commons users, web 2.0 platforms, the Linux community, file sharers and remix culture.

Almost a decade on, it’s clear that social media and its Maoist counterparts have not brought about the end of the individual identity. Indeed, culture appears more fractured than ever, we are more likely to criticise Facebook for creating divided [echo chambers](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/03/the-social-media-echo-chamber-is-real/) than pervasive groupthink. In answer to Lanier’s fears about anonymity, Snowden showed that we  were never really anonymous in the first place. Against the apparently communist agenda of seemingly free and open user-generated content, tech companies like Facebook and Google have become capitalist behemoths, buying or crushing startups and turning over billions in profit.[^schooloflife]

Of course, predicting the future is difficult and the text has much to offer aside from prescience. In chapter one, Lanier argues, with reference to specific examples, that the nature digital technologies are not inevitable but constructed.
“The design of the web as it appears today was not inevitable.”

This might seem like the exaggerations of radical postmodernism.
Tim Berners-Lee around the same like was talking about designing the web as philosophical engineering. In an informal video interview posted to DailyMotion he said; “It struck me that when we are designing web protocols we’re actually defining the way a new world works and creating a new world… so people, when they use your system, to a certain extent, they have to leave their philosophy at the door… and they have to [agree to] work according to your system. So you can build systems, worlds which have different properties.”[^Berners-Lee2010]

“Before MIDI, a musical note was a bottomless idea that transcended absolute definition.”

His argument appears at first glance to follow a common pattern of humanistic research, which might be called *deconstruction*.[^definition]
Take a ubiquitous and unexamined contemporary idea. Recontextualise it within the history of ideas from which it emerged. Show how this context shaped its development and examine contemporaneous alternative ideas that might have created alternative presents. In short, show the idea to be constructed and contingent so it may be reopened for development.
Only, Lanier takes a fatalistic turn with his concept of lock-in. The Web, MIDI and filesystems, even when shown to be constructed cannot be fixed. The opportunity has been forever lost.

The politics of technology affect the politics of society, especially as society becomes increasingly digitised.
“We [technologists] tinker with your philosophy by direct manipulation of your cognitive experience… It takes only a tiny 
group of engineers to create technology that can shape the entire future of human experience.”




“Digital Reification: Lock-in Turns Philosophy into Reality “




The dominance of discrete (digital) over continuous (analog) encodings.




Vint Cerf argues that internet access cannot be subjected to law because digital technology is an artefact which can change – and which never stops changing.[^Stiegler2012]






Ironically, *You Are Not a Gadget* may have been one of the turning points in discourse that has left us where we are today.


I am reminded of the open source social network *Diaspora* which seemed to offer refuge to refugees of oppressive mass-surveillance platforms. 
Alternatively, Google made a long standing attempt to overthrow Facebook.

[^definition]: David B. Allison, introduction to [*Speech and Phenomena*](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=N4v2AkGMnqcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=take%20apart&f=false) defines deconstruction as “a project of critical thought whose task is to locate and 'take apart' those concepts which serve as the axioms or rules for a period of thought, those concepts which command the unfolding of an entire epoch of metaphysics.”  (p. xxxiii)

[^schooloflife]: There’s [a moment](https://youtu.be/lbdYg_z_SAE?t=48m23s) recorded in a live conversation between Lanier and [James Bridle](http://jamesbridle.com/) at the School of Life in London, where Bridle pushes back on Lanier’s proposed  solutions to technology; “Aren’t those approaches exactly what will be impossible in a more pervasive technological system like the one that you propose as the next step for freedom in this? If everything that we do, if every action, if every contribution is tracked, monitored, surveilled and and put in a capitalist framework of reward, doesn’t that approach of cutting yourself off become completely impossible?”
