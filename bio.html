<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
Kieran Browne is a Canberra based artist. He was born in a mining town in western New South Wales and grew up in various towns and cities around the state. His work combines new and old media; seeking ways to make new technologies visible and tangible. This follows the work of artists like Harold Cohen and Natalie Jeremijenko.</p>

<p>Kieran began his creative life intending to make films. By a happy accident he was introduced to programming while at art school and began making images with code. Software grew to occupy more and more of his practice but his interest in old media remained.</p>

<p>Between 2014 and 2016 he built a series of artificial artists / drawing machines. These would seek out and consume online images to generate large format pen and charcoal drawings. These works probed at the definitions of "artist" and "creative" and aimed to expand these to non-humans.</p>

<p>In 2017 Kieran began working on a PhD in contemporary artificial intelligence. He is critical of the use of AI to influence social realities through policing, media distribution, banking etc. He is building artefacts that make the strangeness of these technologies readable.</p>

<p>In 2018, he exhibited a work 'Trace' in the National Gallery of Australia.</p>
