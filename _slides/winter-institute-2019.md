{% include slide/standard.html title="Schmidhuber's overview" %}
<p>Begins section on early neural networks with McCulloch and Pitts in the 1940s but gives passing reference to history of methods;</p>
<p><b>"In a sense [neural networks] have been around even longer, since early supervised NNs were essentially variants
of linear regression methods going back at least to the early 1800s (e.g., Legendre, 1805; Gauss, 1809,
1821)"</b></p>
<p>Allows Schmidhuber to admit the origin of methods but maintain the simulation of the brain as the central narrative</p>

{% include slide/standard.html title="The McCulloch-Pitts neuron" %}
<p>The McCulloch-Pitts neuron followed from a number of axioms derived from the existing theories of neurophysiology and empirical evidence.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The activity of the neuron is an 'all-or-none' process.</li>
  <li>A certain fixed number of synapses must be excited withing the period of alatent addition in order to excite a neuron at any time, and this number is independent of previous activity and position of the neuron.</li>
  <li>The only significant delay within the nervous system is synaptic delay.</li>
  <li>The activity of any inhibitory synapse absolutely prevents excitation of the neuron at that time.</li>
  <li>The structure of the net does not change with time.</li>
</ul>
